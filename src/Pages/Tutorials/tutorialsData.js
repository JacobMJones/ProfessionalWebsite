      "At well over 10 000 words, and covering Higher Order Components, composition, and the Context API, this lengthy and thorough tutorial formed the backbone of the authentication system I built during my last contract. It also introduced me to a very managable and extendable way to use the Context API to create an API to interact with Firebase. All of Robin Wieruch's React tutorials are excellent, he is my go to person when it comes to learning about React."

I got to setup a RESTful API and learn how to deal with the asynchronicity, in this case by using call backs, inherent in working with databases. This was also the tutorial that begun my love hate relationship with jQuery. This tutorial was part of Lighthouse Labs' bootcamp curriculum."

While I would eventually move away from GreenSock in favor of smaller libraries or just making my own animations in CSS, the author of the GreenSock 101 lessons, Petr Tichy, was invaluable in explaining the key concepts in CSS animation."

      "There are 25 videos in this series and they contain little to no fluff. This series introduced me to many programming concepts, such as abstraction, finite state machines, inheritance, and interfaces. It was also my first exposure to just how much planning is required in order to make efficient and reusable code. The series was long, and I had to rewind most of the videos many times, but completing it gave me a much clearer idea about what it means to be a programmer."
