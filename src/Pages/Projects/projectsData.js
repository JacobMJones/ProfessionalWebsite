What's more, it showed me the tremendous amount of work that is involved in creating a proper video game. Building this game was a way of exploring if I wanted to become a professional programmer."

In addition to the game, it also generated tests parents could give their children at home. The greatest challenge of this project was the QA process, specifically getting the application to look good on various phone sizes. It currently has over 500 active users! Which is awesome considering it had only been created for my class."
