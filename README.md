This is my personal website. It serves as a clearing house for stuff related to web dev. It is also an ongoing project I use to experiment. I try and make this code base as clean as possible and follow best practices. That said, since I use this code base to learn, some things are overly engineered (or weirdly engineered, currently I provide a data object through the context API as a way of learning about providing context) or at times (hopefully brief) a complete mess. 

Currently uses:

*[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
*[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
*[react-awesome-button](https://github.com/rcaferati/react-awesome-button)
*[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
*[animate-css-styled-components](https://github.com/dielduarte/animate-css-styled-components)
