  "description": "This is my personal website. It serves as a clearing house for stuff related to web dev. It is also an ongoing project I use to experiment. I try and make this code base as clean as possible and follow best practices. That said, since I use this code base to learn, some things are overly engineered (or weirdly engineered, currently I provide a data object through the context API as a way of learning about providing context) or at times (hopefully brief) a complete mess.",
